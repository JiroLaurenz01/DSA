        /*  LINKED LIST = NODES ARE IN 2 PARTS (DATA + ADDRESS)
                          NODES ARE IN NON CONSECUTIVE MEMORY LOCATIONS
                          ELEMENTS ARE LINKED USING POINTERS
            
            ADVANTAGES:
                1. DYNAMIC DATA STRUCTURE (ALLOCATES NEEDED MEMORY WHILE RUNNING).
                2. INSERTION AND DELETION OF NODES IS EASY. O(1)
                3. NO/LOW MEMORY WASTE.

            DISADVANTAGES:
                1. GREATER MEMORY USAGE (ADDITIONAL POINTER).
                2. NO RANDOM ACCESS OF ELEMENTS (NO INDICES).
                3. ACCESSING / SEARCHING ELEMENTS IS MORE TIME CONSUMING. O(n)

            USES OF LINKED LIST:
                    1. IMPLEMENT STACKS / QUEUE
                    2. GPS NAVIGATION
                    3. MUSIC PLAYLIST  */
